# AUTHENTICATION WITH DEVISE GEM

This assignment consists of using the Devise gem to have a first approach at authentication in rails. We built this application that allows users to create posts and the authors of the posts are displayed only if as a User you are logged in.

## About

This project aimed to learn the basics of authentication using devise gem.

We started the project by setting up the backend. 

* Designed a data model for this application having Users with simple identification attributes like `:name`, `:email` and `:password`.
* We connected the user's table to the post's table by the foreign key `:user_id`.
* Added devise to the gem file and installed in the app.
* Created a Post model and a Posts controller and a corresponding resource in your Routes file which allows the [`:new`, `:create`, `:index`] methods
* Used a `#before_action` to restrict access to the #new and #create methods to only users who are signed in. 
* Created the necessary helper methods in the ApplicationController.
* Wrote a simple form in the app/views/posts/new.html.erb view to create a new Post.
* Filled out the #index action of the PostsController and created the corresponding view. The view shows a list of every post.
* Added logic in the Index view to display the author‚Äôs name, but only if a user is signed in.
* Tested it out ‚Äì signed in and created new posts in the index page. Then signed out and could no longer see the author's names.
* Checked our work by visiting `http://localhost:3000/posts/new`.

That should return the version of Ruby that's running on your computer. 

If you need to install Ruby, follow the instructions in this [webpage](https://www.ruby-lang.org/en/documentation/installation/).

### Installing Rails

You should also have Rails installed in your computer.

Follow the instructions in this tutorial to install Rails [webpage](https://www.theodinproject.com/courses/ruby-on-rails/lessons/your-first-rails-application-ruby-on-rails)

### Clone the repo

Go ahead and clone the repo.

## Development

After cloning the repo, you should fire up a server. Open a command line terminal and paste the following command:

- Clone the repository : `git clone <https://github.com/guirecordon/members-only>`
- Drop the database : `rails db:drop`
- Create the database: `rails db:create`
- Run migration: rails `db:migrate`
- Then serve, `rails serve` or `rails s`

After that, open your browser and type the following in your address bar: 

`http://localhost:3000`

That will take you to the main form where you can create a new user. Fill out all the fields. If they pass validation, the form should be emptied out. Otherwise, you should get an error message on top of your form.
